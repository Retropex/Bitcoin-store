description: >-
  Take control of your digital sovereignty by choosing Garbageman to run your node! By using Garbageman, you’re supporting a version of Bitcoin that prioritizes efficiency, security, and flexibility. With Bitcoin Knots’ enhanced configuration options, you can fine-tune your node to help keep the network clean and resilient, actively reducing unnecessary load from spam or parasitic transactions.


  Every node strengthens the Bitcoin network, and your decision to use Garbageman contributes directly to a more decentralized and spam-resistant ecosystem. Your node not only validates and secures transactions but also sets an example for a more sustainable, user-focused Bitcoin network.


  Welcome to the community of Garbageman users, and thank you for helping Bitcoin grow stronger!
